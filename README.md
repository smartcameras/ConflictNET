# Conflict-Intensity-Estimation
Estimate the level of verbal conflict from raw speech signals

An end-to-end CNN-LSTM architecture with attention mechanism using Keras with Tensorflow backend.

# Procedure

1. Download the dataset from (http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~vincia/dataconflict/)

2. Create train, val and test split according to the following paper

Schuller, Bj√∂rn, et al. "The INTERSPEECH 2013 computational paralinguistics challenge: Social signals, conflict, emotion, autism." Proceedings INTERSPEECH 2013, 14th Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association, Lyon, France. 2013.

3. Change lines 10,11 and 12 in 'dataLoad.py' by providing the train, val and test paths in your computer.

4. Run 'conflict_net.py'
